# Neovim configuration

This is my (maybe) platform agnostic and modular neovim configuration. The main goal of this
repository is to create a configuration that 

- can be easily modified, and
- it _just works_ anywhere

At least on the platforms I mainly use: Windows, Linux and Termux.

## Philosophy

To achieve these goals, this repository will adhere to the following guidelines:

- External dependencies (plugins, programs or terminal emulators) must not
  compromise the core functionality.
- Prefer neovim core API or stable dependencies.
- If a dependency is absolutely needed. Make patches to ensure its stability.
- All dependant features should be accesible only when the necessary requirements
  are met and should function as expected regardless of the platform.
- Users are responsible for fulfilling the software requirements and
  deciding which features to enable.
- The program should assists users in meeting these requirements as much
  as possible.
